# Flipkart-clone
In this project I have created a clone of  popular e-commerce website named 
Flipkart and I have used three languages to make it.
The languages are HTML , CSS and Javascript .  
I have created various boxes which represents different sections of  the website.
For eg: If I am selling a cupboard  then in which variations it would be available and at what price would it be sold all the details will be displayed in different boxes or containers.
Then I will be creating a navigation bar using the nav tag in HTML  to help users to use this app quite comfortably. 
In the CSS part I will be giving  various designs  to make the website attractive  and  I will also be setting the size of the navigation bar and the boxes as well.
The flex property is a very crucial property as it allows the items to take only that space which is required.
All the images and the logo of the website has been downloaded from chrome  browser as it is a dummy project. 
In the Javascript section we will see that whenever a user wants to purchase an item  then with the help of certain buttons such as add to cart he can buy it. Now by putting the trigger event on the button we have to use the Javascript concept.
The most important property in Javascript i.e. addEventListner which gives a message that we have to trigger a  button.
Then after we have to also declare various functions in JS because there are much items which we will be selling in this website and therefore we have to create a function  as well. 
So this is a brief description about my project website.
